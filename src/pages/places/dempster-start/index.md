The start of the Dempster Highway is near Dawson City, on the banks of the Klondike River. Though excited about the adventure ahead, the beginning of the Dempster Highway is a nice wayside to rest at and fuel up. The cardlock gas is a bit cheaper here than in Dawson City, and it's an interesting experience going to a gas station without any employee.

People tend to stop here for several minutes to rest. There was a local lady with her child walking around for about a half an hour, but the tourists tend to only stay for about 5 minutes.
