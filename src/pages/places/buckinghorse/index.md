Buckinghorse River Adventures has a motel and cabins you can rent. There is a restaurant, and the owners also are adventure guides specializing in hunting bears and other wild game. The location includes a campground, and there is an additional provicial campground across the road past the barracks called "Buckinghorse River Wayside Campground".

The owners are friendly, and you will likely see them jotting around in an ATV. At the time, there is no gas station, but they will be installing one at some point in 2023. The only fuel availible is propane.

This drone survey was done by request of the owners, and I only had one battery left after flying the barracks across the road. This prevented me from getting low-level detail of the structures, but it is an ok overview of the property in the orthoimagery.
