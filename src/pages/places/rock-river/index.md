I highly recommend camping at the Rock River Campground on the Northern leg of the Dempster Highway in the Yukon. It is in the foothills of the Richardson Mountains, and the river is very clear and peaceful. The campsites are well kept, with free firewood. Make sure to bring an axe; we had to borrow one from a neighbor!

Laura and Opal were with me, and I ventured away from the campground further upstream to map with my drone. I don't like to fly too close to campers.

Often on this trip (2023 Roadtrip to Tuktoayaktuk) I had to choose between the drone and fishing, and on this instance, I chose to map with my drone. The fishing probably would have been good too!

Still, I did get to spend some quality time relaxing next to the Rock River. You too can enjoy this river for an entire hour with this video I put on YouTube!

If you look closely along the Dempster Highway, you can see flags and other signs of disturbed ground. A fiber-optic line was recently installed along the Western side of the highway.
