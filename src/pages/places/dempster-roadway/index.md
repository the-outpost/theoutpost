Here I experiment with mapping a long stretch of roadway using the "Corridor" flight plan in DJI Pilot. The goal here is to cover a long portion of roadway and see how far I can get with my rover from the base station using the LoRa connection.

The base is not fixed to any NTRIP, but I did average points for 20 mins. The rover, however, connects to the base via the LoRa radio, and this provides precision, which is more important than accuracy in this context.

I can easily get about 5km of distance from the base. The signal goes far, and it is typically hills and other obstructions that limit the range.
