Just a few miles from Eagle Plains, the Eagle River is a picturesque serpentine river with a nice bridge. There is a pull-off with a short track down to the waterfront. I was hoping to stay that night at the Eagle Plains Motel, but all of the rooms were booked. I recommend booking a room in advance, as that establishment is very busy during the summer months.

I attemped to fish at the Eagle River, but I did not catch anything.

One woman who is parterns with the owner of Eagle Plains was there with several dogs that you might see lounging around at Eagle Plains.
