Of all of the roads I traveled on during my 2023 roadtrip to Tuktoyaktuk, the Campbell Highway was the wildest and most remote. Only hard pack, it is in a similar condition to the Dempster Highway, though there are far fewer travelors. If I am ever able to return to the Yukon, I will want to focus my attention on the Campbell.

Initially I wanted to map the nearby Frances Lake, but there were several campers there, and I did not want to disturb them with my drone. There I met a guy who works as a foreman at a mine near Faro. He was waving around a strange device that looked like a pistol, but it was actually a satellite phone. He was on the shore of the lake, saying that this area has better clearance for reception. He had a boat at his campsite, and he mentioned that the fishing is very good there.

A few miles North up the road I found a turnoff that leads towards the Finlayson River. I was surprised to see several cabins along the way, with one that appears not abandoned. There is a sign by the door that says "Kitty's Kabin". It looks like noone has been there recently--perhaps it is primarily used during the winter months? It is beautifully built, and it reminds me of the cabin [Dick Proenneke built](https://youtu.be/hy-4NxJRxNQ). The photo I included is of an abandoned cabin nearby, as I am pretty sure "Kitty's Kabin" is still in use.

The road got very muddy towards the river, so I did not get all the way there. If I did, I bet the fishing would have been phenominal. Maybe next time!

Near the abandoned cabin, there was a survey post. Interestingly, a sign was placed next to the post to make the location very obvious! Is this to help along the next surveyor?
