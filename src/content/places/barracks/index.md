This is exactly the location I have been looking for to create a mesh. Across the road is Buckinghorse River Adventures, with a motel and restaurant. It looked like a good place to spend the night, take a shower, and rest. This part of British Columbia has a lot of oil industry, and these barracks are a good example. According to the folks at the motel, Northgate brought out these semi-mobile industrial barracks to house personnel, but they haven't used it since 2013. Since then, it has been semi-abandoned. It is looked after by security, as well as the folks at the motel, so the property is in surprisingly good condition. No vandalism.

This mesh could create a compelling scene in a post-apocalyptic video game with items such as a radio tower, satellite dishes, generators, shipping containers, and more.
